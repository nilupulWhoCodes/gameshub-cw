						The main way players in esports make money is by either creating an esports team or joining one. 
						Then they participate in tournaments where they have the chance to win a part of the overall prize pool.
						The esports industry is very mature today. It reached revenues of $957 million in 2019 and crossed the billion-dollar mark in 2021 when it surpassed revenues of $1.08 billion.
						 What’s more, it’s expected to reach $1.61 billion by 2024.					
						It’s a massive industry, meaning that the tournament rewards are getting to larger levels with every passing year. 
						Major tournaments in the most popular games like League of Legends, CSGO, and Dota 2 typically have prize pools that reach or exceed $1 million, and the better the team ranks in it, the more money it will earn.					
						Furthermore, additional esports tournaments appear each year due to the rise in popularity. But that’s not all, many teams are under contract and are paid for their participation, and in some cases, teams even get a portion of the revenues the games make. Many video game publishers see the benefits of paying esports teams to promote their games.

			Game designers focus on the function of a game, creating systems, rules, and gameplay, and help with world-building 
			(story and IP) to ensure it’s playable, fun, and engaging. 
			They oversee both the foundation and execution of the game mechanics and overall user experience.
			Game designers need to be highly technical and very adept at solving complex problems on a daily basis.
			The job description of a Game Designer can differ slightly depending on the size and type of a project, 
			and the studio. Typically, as games become more complex and teams become larger, some of the traditional 
			roles of a Game Designer are separated out into specializations such as a Level Designer and/or a Systems Designer.
			Level Designers focus on creating and implementing levels, environments, stories, and quests, while Systems Designers focus on designing and
			then implementing the minute-to-minute gameplay systems which make the game fun like controls, movement, and combat.
