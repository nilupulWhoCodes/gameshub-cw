    <h1 id="top">The Future of Gaming: What to Expect in the Years to Come
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="intro">
        Gaming has come a long way since the days of Pong and Space Invaders. From the rise of console gaming to the
        advent of mobile games, the industry has seen constant evolution and growth. So what can we expect from the
        future of gaming? Here are some of the key trends to watch out for in the years to come.


    </p>
    <hr>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Cloud Gaming</h3>
        <p class="content">Cloud gaming is already making waves in the industry, and it's only set to get bigger in the
            coming years. Essentially, cloud gaming allows users to play games on remote servers rather than on their
            own hardware. This means that players can enjoy high-quality, high-performance games on a range of devices,
            without the need for expensive hardware upgrades. With companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon
            investing heavily in cloud gaming, it's clear that this trend is here to stay.
        </p>
        <h3>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</h3>
        <p class="content">Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have been around for a while, but they're
            finally starting to gain mainstream acceptance. With the launch of the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and
            PlayStation VR, gamers can now experience immersive gaming like never before. Meanwhile, augmented reality
            is finding its way into mobile games like Pok√©mon Go and Ingress, and is set to become even more prevalent
            in the years to come.
        </p>
        <h3>Esports</h3>
        <p class="content">Esports has exploded in popularity over the last few years, and it shows no signs of slowing
            down. With major tournaments offering multi-million dollar prizes and top players becoming global
            celebrities, esports is now a legitimate career choice for many young people. As the industry continues to
            grow, we can expect to see more investment, more tournaments, and more players entering the scene.
        </p>
        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p class="content">Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being used in a range of games, from strategy titles
            to first-person shooters. However, as AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more
            impressive applications in the years to come. This could include games that adapt to a player's individual
            style, or AI-driven NPCs that offer more realistic and immersive interactions.
        </p>
        <h3>Subscription Gaming</h3>
        <p class="content">Subscription gaming services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Now are already gaining
            popularity, and they're only set to become more prevalent in the future. With these services, players can
            access a huge library of games for a monthly fee, rather than having to purchase individual titles. This
            model is particularly attractive to younger players, who may not have the funds to buy every new release.
        </p>
        <h3>Cross-Platform Gaming</h3>
        <p class="content">Cross-platform gaming has been a hot topic for a while now, but we're finally starting to see
            some major breakthroughs. With titles like Fortnite allowing players to play with friends on different
            platforms, it's clear that the industry is moving towards a more open, inclusive model. As cross-platform
            gaming becomes more widespread, we can expect to see even more games that allow players to connect with
            others regardless of their chosen device.
        </p>
        <h3>Mobile Gaming</h3>
        <p class="content">Mobile gaming has been a huge success story over the last few years, and it's only set to
            become more popular in the future. With the launch of the Nintendo Switch, mobile gaming is now more
            accessible than ever, and it's clear that the industry is moving towards a more open, inclusive model. As
            cross-platform gaming becomes more widespread, we can expect to see even more games that allow players to
            connect with others regardless of their chosen device.
